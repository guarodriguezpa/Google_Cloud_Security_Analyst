**Acces a Firewall and create a rule**

**Cloud Firewall Management and Perimeter Protection (Google Cloud
Lab)**

In this Google Cloud lab, I focused on **perimeter protection and
network traffic management** for Cymbal Bank\'s demo web server, which
was provisioned on an existing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

My objective was to analyze and secure inbound network traffic by
creating and testing firewall rules, ensuring unnecessary ports were
blocked.

My actions involved accessing the existing firewall configurations. I
began by **creating a firewall rule to specifically allow necessary HTTP
traffic** to the web server, enabling connectivity.

After allowing traffic, I **generated HTTP network traffic to the server
and analyzed its associated network logs** to understand the traffic
patterns. Next, I designed and implemented a **new firewall rule to deny
HTTP traffic** to the server, testing its effectiveness by attempting to
connect again.

Finally, I **analyzed the firewall logs to confirm that the deny rule
was working as intended**, successfully blocking the specified traffic.

Task 1. Create a firewall rule

In this task, I\'ll create a firewall rule that allows HTTP and SSH
connectivity. You will also specify a target tag for the newly created
firewall rule.

In Google Cloud, firewall rules must specify *targets* to define which
VM instances they apply to. *Target tags* can be used to apply a
firewall rule to a specific group of VMs, helping simplify the
management of firewall rules. You\'ll use target tags to enable this
firewall rule to the web server only.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu** (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0f03e0-0c52-473b-8574-357fa0cce3fd)
.

2.  Select **VPC Network \> Firewall**. The **Firewall policies** page
    displays.

<!-- -->

3.  On the toolbar, click **+ Create Firewall Rule**. The **Create a
    firewall rule** dialog displays.

4.  Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their
    defaults:

## Task 2. Generate HTTP network traffic

In this task, I\'ll generate HTTP network traffic to the web server by
visiting its external IP address. The network traffic you generate will
then be recorded as logs that you can analyze in the Logs Explorer.

**First**, I need to generate network traffic.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu** (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7daeedb8-878a-4b90-8967-df32a0eb2bac)


2.  Select **Compute Engine \> VM instances**. The **VM instances** page
    opens.

3.  For **web-server**, click on the **External IP** link to access the
    server.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c059ed8e-deff-4baa-b428-fc6c31d8e431)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4327625-f6a3-4413-99c6-da6ae3dbee01)


**Next**, I need to find the IP address of the computer you're using.

4.  Access yMY IP address using the following
    link [whatismyip.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/). It will directly
    reply with your IP.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2401961-184a-4250-95ed-4ee1011160ff)


***Note: **Ensure that the IP address only contains numerals (IPv4) and
is not represented in hexadecimal (IPv6).*

5.  Copy the **IP address** and save it in a notepad. You'll need to use
    this in the next task

## Task 3. Analyze the web server Flow Logs

In this task, I\'ll access and analyze the VPC Flow Logs for the web
server using the Logs Explorer.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu** (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/733bee95-acec-490a-8ee2-43daeb23734f)
.

2.  Select **Logging \> Logs Explorer**. The **Logs Explorer** page
    opens. (You may need to expand the **More Products** drop-down menu
    within the **Navigation** menu and locate Logging
    under **Operations**.)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad85f0f7-334f-44b5-8644-ed6019b473bd)


3.  On the left side of the **Logs Explorer** page, the **Log
    fields** pane is presented. The **Resource
    type** and **Severity** sections are available. Under the **Resource
    type** section, select **Subnetwork**.

Entries from the subnetwork logs will display on the **Query
results** pane to the right of the **Log fields** pane.

4.  On the **Log fields** pane, in the **Log name** section,
    select **compute.googleapis.com/vpc_flows** to access the VPC Flow
    logs for the network

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ea11413-fdda-483a-9cbb-53e418b8648d)


Once selected, entries from the VPC Flow Logs display on the **Query
results** pane.

5.  In the **Query** builder at the top of the page, at the end of line
    2, press **ENTER** to create a new line.

6.  On line 3, enter the following:

\#####

jsonPayload.connection.src_ip=YOUR_IP

\#####

THE query should resemble the following:

resource.type=\"gce_subnetwork\"

log_name=\"projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Fvpc_flows\"

jsonPayload.connection.src_ip=YOUR_IP

7.  Replace YOUR_IP with the IP address you saved from Task 2. This
    query will search for network traffic logs originating from your IP
    address that you had generated in the previous task.

8.  Click **Run query**. The query results should display on the **Query
    results** pane.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a44d113-7b30-43ca-8474-263bb3e84670)


9.  In the **Query results** pane, expand one of the log entries.

10. Within the entry, expand **jsonPayload** by clicking the expand
    arrow **\>**. Then, expand the **connection** field.

11. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9731c70e-9818-4920-945e-181d899a53d4)


Here you can examine the details about the network connection to the web
server:

- **dest_ip** - This is the destination IP address of the web server.

- **dest_port** - This is the destination port number of the web server
  which is HTTP port 80.

- **protocol** - The protocol is 6 which is the IANA protocol for TCP
  traffic.

- **src_ip** - This is the source IP address of your computer.

- **src_port** - This is the source port number that\'s assigned to your
  computer. According to Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
  standards, this is typically a random port number between 49152-65535.

After analyzing the details of this log entry, you should notice that
the network traffic you generated (on HTTP port 80) was allowed due to
the firewall rule **allow-http-ssh** you created previously. This rule
allowed incoming traffic on ports 80 and 22.

## Task 4. Create a firewall rule to deny HTTP traffic

In this task, I\'ll create a new firewall rule that denies traffic
from port 80.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/735bcbb1-4fd0-4729-aac9-d530e16737a0)


2.  Select **VPC network** \> **Firewall**. The Firewall policies page
    displays.

3.  On the toolbar, click **+ Create Firewall Rule**.

Task 5. Analyze the firewall logs

In this task, I\'ll test the **deny-http** firewall rule that you
created in the previous task.

**First**, attempt to connect to the web server.

1.  Click the **Navigation menu** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d2d6ade-1a0d-4219-b4f4-d467dae15973)


2.  Select **Compute Engine \> VM instances**. The **VM instances** page
    opens.

3.  For **web-server**, click on the **External IP** link to access the
    server.

The following error message should display on the page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e40e52fe-9963-4391-8432-63cdeed6212b)


This error occurred because of the **deny-http** firewall rule you
created in the previous task. To verify this, access the Logs Explorer
to analyze the firewall logs for the web server.

4.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu**![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b4ccdf7-41cd-4303-bb24-f794156a7273)

5.  Select **Logging \> Logs Explorer**. The **Logs Explorer** page
    opens. (You may need to expand the **More Products** drop-down menu
    within the **Navigation** menu and locate Logging
    under **Operations**.)

6.  Under the **Resource type** section, select **Subnetwork**.

7.  On the **Log fields** pane, in the **Log name** section,
    select **compute.googleapis.com/firewall** to access the firewall
    logs for the network.

8.  In the **Query** builder at the top of the page, at the end of line
    2, press **ENTER** to create a new line.

9.  On line 3, enter the following:

\######

jsonPayload.connection.src_ip=YOUR_IP DENIED

\#####

Replace YOUR_IP with the IP address you saved from Task 2. This query
will search for firewall logs that denied your IP address connection to
the web server. Your query should resemble the following:

resource.type=\"gce_subnetwork\"

log_name=\"projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/compute.googleapis.com%2Ffirewall\"

jsonPayload.connection.src_ip=YOUR_IP DENIED

10. Click **Run query**. The query results should display on the Query
    results pane.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96c66931-982b-41ee-8f8e-ef6e65110f6b)


11. In the **Query results** pane, expand one of the log entries.

12. Within the log entry, expand the **jsonPayload** field by clicking
    the expand arrow **\>**. Then, expand the **connection** field. You
    can examine the details about the network connection to the web
    server to verify if the firewall rule was successfully triggered:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fea421f-6430-4d03-afa0-1f2196431cac)


- **dest_ip** - This is the destination IP address of the web server
  which is **10.1.3.2**.

- **dest_port** - This is the destination port number of the web server
  which is HTTP port **80**.

- **protocol** - The protocol is **6** which is the IANA protocol for
  TCP traffic.

- **src_ip** - This is the source IP address of your computer.

- **src_port** - This is the source port number that\'s assigned to your
  computer.

- **disposition** - This field indicates whether the connection was
  allowed or denied. Here, it\'s **denied** which indicates that the
  connection to the server was denied.

13. Within the log entry, expand the **rule_details** field by clicking
    the expand arrow **\>**. You can examine the details about the
    firewall rule. Additionally, you can extract more information from
    the following fields in the log entry by expanding them:

- **action** - The action taken by the rule, **DENY** in this case.

- **direction** - The rule\'s traffic direction can be either ingress or
  egress, here it is **INGRESS** which means the action will apply to
  incoming traffic.

- **ip_port_info** - The protocol and ports this rule controls.
  The **ip_protocol** and **port_range** lists **TCP port 80**.

- **source_range** - The traffic sources that the firewall rule is
  applied to. Here it is **0.0.0.0/0**.

- **target_tag** - This lists all the target tags that the firewall rule
  applies to. Here, it is **http-server**, the target tag you added to
  the firewall rule in the previous task.

By examining the details of this firewall log entry, you should notice
that the firewall rule **deny-http** you set up to deny HTTP traffic was
successfully triggered. This rule denied incoming network traffic on
port 80.

## Conclusion

This lab strengthened my skills in **Google Cloud firewall rule
creation, network security, traffic control, and log analysis**.

It provided hands-on experience in implementing perimeter protection
measures and validating their effectiveness, which is key for
maintaining application security and policy enforcement in a cloud
environment. The outcome was a **securely configured web server with
properly defined firewall rules**, demonstrating my ability to manage
network access and protect cloud assets.
