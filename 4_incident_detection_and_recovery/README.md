# Labs & Activity: Incident Detection and Response â€“ Cymbal Bank Scenario

This folder documents the labs and activity for Course 4 in the Google Cloud Security certification path. It continues the Cymbal Bank simulation, where I serve as a Junior Cloud Security Analyst focused on detecting, documenting, and responding to cloud security incidents.

## ðŸ§© Scenario Overview

Cymbal Bank has advanced in its digital transformation, and the focus now shifts to cloud incident response. As a junior cloud security analyst, I worked alongside the Incident Response Team to simulate, detect, analyze, and recover from potential threats in a cloud environment.

This course emphasized foundational practices in threat detection, log analysis, false positive recognition, and virtual machine recovery.

## ðŸ§ª Labs & ðŸ”¨ Activity

### ðŸš¨ Incident Detection and Investigation

- **Determine the difference between normal activity and an incident**  
  Recreated threat findings related to two user accounts and differentiated between suspicious and normal behavior.

- **Explore false positives through incident detection**  
  Reproduced a false alert scenario to understand alert triggers and improve detection accuracy.

- **Analyze audit logs using BigQuery**  
  Reconstructed a high-severity incident and investigated logs to identify root causes and affected resources.

### ðŸ“‹ Documentation and Recovery

- **Document a timeline of events**  
  Analyzed a phishing case and created a detailed timeline from alert to resolution.

- **Recover VMs with Google Backup and DR Service**  
  Restored compromised virtual machines from known good backups to complete remediation.

## âœ… Key Takeaways

Through these hands-on tasks, I gained experience in:

- Incident detection using event logs and threat findings
- Differentiating legitimate behavior from suspicious activity
- Understanding and responding to false positives
- Constructing incident timelines for documentation and response
- Restoring cloud infrastructure as part of recovery operations

These activities serve as real-world practice in managing the lifecycle of a cloud security incident â€” skills essential to cloud security operations and response teams.
