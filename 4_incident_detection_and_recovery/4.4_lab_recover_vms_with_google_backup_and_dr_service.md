Recover VMs with Google Backup and DR Service

**Implementing Cloud Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity with
Google Cloud Backup and DR Service (Google Cloud Lab)**

In this Google Cloud lab, I contributed to **business continuity and
disaster recovery efforts** by assisting Cymbal Bank\'s Incident
Response Team with the recovery of affected virtual machines (VMs) after
a security incident. My core objective was to utilize Google Cloud
Backup and DR Service to protect and restore Compute Engine instances,
ensuring quick resumption of critical business operations.

My actions began by **connecting to the Backup and DR management
console**, which is the central interface for managing backup and
recovery operations.

I then **created and validated a backup plan template**, which defines
how data will be backed up and retained.

A key step involved **discovering and adding a Compute Engine instance**
to the Backup and DR management console, enabling its protection.

Finally, to simulate recovery and demonstrate the service\'s
capabilities, I **restored a Compute Engine instance into two different
Google Cloud projects**, proving the ability to recover data to new
locations.

## Task 1. Connect to the Backup and DR console

Before I can begin implementing recovery actions, I\'ll first need to
connect to the Backup and DR console.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click the **Navigation
    menu** (![Navigation Menu
    icon](media/image1.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}) \> **Backup and DR**. (You will
    have to click **More Products** and then scroll down to
    find **Backup and DR** in the **Operations** section).

2.  From left nevigation pane, click **Management console**

## Task 2. Create a backup plan template

In this task, I'll create a backup plan template.

Backup plan templates are composed of backup policies. In policies, you
define when to run a backup, how frequently to run a backup, and how
long to retain the backup image for --- **Days**, **Weeks**, **Months**,
or **Years**.

1.  In the Backup and DR management console titlebar, click **Backup
    Plans** \> **Templates**, and then click **+Create Template**.

![](media/image6.png){width="7.241852580927384in"
height="3.9253116797900263in"}

2.  In the **Template** field, set the template name to **vm-backup**.

<!-- -->

3.  In the **Description** field, type **Virtual Machine Backups**.

4.  In the **Policies** box, next to **Snapshot,** click **+ Add** to
    add a production to snapshot backup policy.

The **Production to Snapshot** dialog opens.

5.  In the **Create/Edit Policy** section, set the following fields and
    leave all other settings at their defaults:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Field                                     Value
  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------
  **Policy Name**                           Daily VM snapshot

  **Scheduling**                            Continuous

  **Every**                                 2 Hour(s)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

• **Windowed** defines a discrete snapshot backup schedule adhering to a
specific frequency and time window.\
• **Continuous** defines a continuous snapshot backup Schedule

## Task 3. Validate the backup and recovery appliance service account permissions

In this task, I'll view the required IAM roles of the backup/recovery
appliance to verify that it has the correct IAM roles.

An appliance is a hardware or software device that is designed to
perform a specific task. Security appliances are used to protect
networks from unauthorized access, attacks, and data breaches.

Every appliance has a dedicated service account attached to it---that
was created during appliance deployment in the project where the
appliance was deployed. For appliances installed on version 11.0.2 and
higher, a corresponding cloud credential for this service account is
automatically created at the time of an appliance deployment.

The name of the cloud credential is based on the appliance name followed
by the suffix -sa. For example, if the name of the backup/recovery
appliance is bur-appliance-us-east1, then the name appliances
corresponding cloud credential is bur-appliance-us-east1-sa.

To view and verify the required IAM role:

1.  Return to the Google Cloud console, in the **Navigation
    menu** (![Navigation Menu
    icon](media/image1.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}), click **IAM & Admin** \> **IAM**.

2.  In the **Name** column, find the service account attached to your
    backup appliance, the service account\'s name should be **Service
    account for backup and recovery appliance**.

![](media/image10.png){width="7.224752843394576in"
height="4.7055446194225725in"}

3.  In the **Role** column, notice that the **Backup and DR Cloud
    Storage Operator role** is already assigned.

## Task 4. Discover and add Compute Engine instances to the management console

In this task, you'll use the **onboarding wizard** to onboard your
Compute Engine instances. Onboarding an instance means you attach the
template to the instance.

1.  Return to the Backup and DR management console.

2.  From the titlebar, click **Backup and Recover** \> **Back Up**.

## Task 6. Restore a Compute Engine instance to an alternate project

In this task, I'll restore a Computer Engine instance using the back up
template I created, but this time to a different project.

I can also create a brand new Compute Engine instance in a different
project from backup images.

To restore a Compute Engine instance to an alternate project, you first
add the service account of project 1 as a principle to Google Cloud
project 2 and then recover the instance on Google Cloud project 2:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, in the Navigation menu (![Navigation
