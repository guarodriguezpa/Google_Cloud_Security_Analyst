Explore false positives through incident detection

**Managing and Remediating False Positives in Cloud Security (Google
Cloud Lab)**

In this Google Cloud lab, I tackled a common challenge in security
operations: **identifying, analyzing, and managing false positive
security alerts**.

As a Cloud Security Analyst, my objective was to understand how a
low-severity alert related to insecure key management was triggered by
benign user activity, and then to remediate both the alert and its
underlying cause.

My actions involved recreating the activity that generated the false
positive. This included **creating a service account, assigning it broad
permissions, providing a user-managed key, and activating the service
account**.

This step allowed me to observe the alert trigger in a controlled
environment. I then used **Security Command Center (SCC)** to access and
analyze the details of the triggered vulnerability finding.}

By examining the alert information, I determined why it was flagged as a
false positive, understanding the difference between the alert
conditions and actual malicious intent. Finally, I took action to
**remediate the vulnerability finding and address the false positive**
by adjusting the IAM settings, which aimed to prevent similar alerts
from occurring in the future due to legitimate actions.

## Task 1. Create a service account

In this task, I'll create a service account and grant it permissions
sufficient to trigger an anomalous threat finding in SCC.

1.  In Google Cloud console, in the **Navigation menu** (![Navigation
    Menu icon](media/image1.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}), click **IAM & Admin \> Service
    Accounts**.

2.  In the action bar, click **+ Create Service Account**.

3.  In the **Service account details** section:

    - In the **Service account name** field, type **test-account**.

> Notice the **Service account ID** automatically populates.

- Click **Create and Continue**.

1.  In the **Grant this service account access to project** section,
    expand the **Select a role** drop-down menu, select **Basic**, and
    then select **Owner**.

2.  Click **Continue**, and then click **Done**.

## Task 2. Create a JSON authentication key for your service account

In this task, I'll create and download a JSON authentication key for the
new service account I created in the previous task. I'll then use Cloud
Shell to upload that key to your Google Cloud account. This will trigger
a threat finding in SCC.

1.  Still on the **Service Accounts** page, inline with
    the **test-account** service account, click **Actions** (![More
    Icon](media/image5.png){width="8.472222222222223e-2in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}) **\> Manage keys**.
    The **test-account** page opens.

2.  In the **Keys** section, click **Add Key \> Create new key**.

3.  In the **Create private key** dialog, set the **Key
    type** to **JSON**.

4.  Click **Create**.

5.  On your local device, navigate to the key file you just downloaded
    and rename it **test-account**.

6.  In the Google Cloud console, click the Activate Cloud Shell
    (![Cloudshell Icon](media/image8.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}) icon.

7.  Click **Continue**.

> It should only take a few moments to provision and connect to the
> Cloud Shell environment.

8.  In the Cloud Shell title bar, click **More** (![More
    Icon](media/image5.png){width="8.472222222222223e-2in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}) **\> Upload \> Choose Files**.

9.  Navigate to and select the file on your local machine, and then in
    the **Upload** dialog, click **Upload**.

![](media/image9.png){width="6.49214457567804in"
height="5.248468941382328in"}

10. Copy the following command into the Cloud Shell terminal:

> \####
>
> ls
>
> \####

This command lists the key file you just uploaded.

11. Press **ENTER**.

In the **test-account** page, in the **Key** list, notice the key you
just created with the **Key creation date** as the current date.

## Task 3. Trigger the false positive finding

In this task, I'll reconfigure the Cloud Shell environment to use the
new **test-account** service account that you created in Task 1. This
will trigger a threat finding in SCC. Then, you'll assign excessive
permissions to the lab project.

1.  Copy the following command into the Cloud Shell terminal:

2.  export PROJECT_ID=\$(gcloud info
    \--format=\'value(config.project)\')

3.  export
    SA_NAME=\"test-account@\${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com\"

> gcloud auth activate-service-account \${SA_NAME}
> \--key-file=test-account.json

This command activates the new service account.

2.  Press **ENTER**.

![](media/image11.png){width="7.351428258967629in"
height="3.542179571303587in"}

3.  Copy the following command into the Cloud Shell terminal:

\#####

> gcloud auth list

#######33

This command confirms that you activated the service account, and that
gcloud is using this service account.

4.  Press **ENTER**.

> In the output, the following confirms the service account is active:

> Output:

>
> ACTIVE: \*
>
> ACCOUNT: test-account@\"Google Cloud project
> ID\".iam.gserviceaccount.com

5.  Copy the following command into the Cloud Shell terminal:

> \######

6.  export STUDENT2=\"Google Cloud username 2\"

> gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding \$PROJECT_ID \--member
> user:\$STUDENT2 \--role roles/editor

\#######

This command grants the editor role to user 2 so that you can access and
remediate the false positive finding in the next task.

6.  Press **ENTER**.

## Task 4. Sign in as the second user

You\'ll need to switch Google Cloud accounts by logging into the Google
Cloud console using the second user account provided in the **Lab
Details** panel. You will use this user account to perform the remaining
tasks.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, click on the user icon in the top-right
    corner of the screen, and then click **Add account**.

2.  Navigate back to the **Lab Details** panel, copy the **Google Cloud
    username 2**: Google Cloud username 2 and **password**. Then, paste
    the username and password into the Google Cloud console **Sign
    in** dialog.

## Task 5. View the threat finding in SCC

In this task, I'll locate and examine the SCC finding generated by the
service Event Threat Detection. This finding is a false positive that
was triggered by the activity you generated in Tasks 1-3.

To view the Event Threat Detection finding in SCC:

1.  In the **Navigation menu** (![Navigation Menu
    icon](media/image1.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}), click **Security \> Findings**.

2.  In the **Quick filters** pane, locate the **Category** section, then
    select **User managed service account key**. If necessary,
    click **View more** to find it.

> The **Findings query results** panel updates to display only the
> selected finding category.

![](media/image15.png){width="6.809440069991251in"
height="4.611643700787401in"}

3.  In the **Findings query results** panel, display the details of the
    finding by clicking the most recent (see **Event time**) **User
    managed service account key** in the **Category** column. The
    details panel for the finding opens and displays
    the **Summary** tab.

![](media/image17.png){width="5.245197944006999in"
height="5.425610236220472in"}

## Task 6. Fix the finding

In this task, you\'ll remediate the false positive by deleting the JSON
authentication key for the **test-account** service account.

1.  In Google Cloud console, in the **Navigation menu** (![Navigation
    Menu icon](media/image1.png){width="0.16041666666666668in"
    height="0.13194444444444445in"}), click **IAM & Admin \> Service
    Accounts**.

2.  On the **Service accounts** page, click the email address of
    the **test-account** service account.

3.  ![](media/image18.png){width="6.696718066491688in"
    height="5.341602143482064in"}

4.  Click the **Keys** tab.

5.  From the list of keys, click the **Delete service account
    key** (![Delete
    Icon](media/image19.png){width="0.24513888888888888in"
    height="0.24513888888888888in"}) icon to delete the key. A pop-up
    will appear asking you to confirm the action. Click **Delete**.

## Conclusion

This lab strengthened my skills in **Google Cloud Security Command
Center (SCC) usage, service account management, IAM policy
understanding, and false positive analysis and remediation**. It
provided hands-on experience in investigating security alerts,
distinguishing between real threats and legitimate activity, and
implementing policy changes to improve alert accuracy. The outcome was a
**clearer understanding of alert generation mechanisms** and the
practical ability to manage and reduce false positives in a cloud
security monitoring system
