## Task 5. Fix the firewall configuration

In this task, I\'ll delete three specific VPC firewall rules that are
responsible for allowing unrestricted access to certain network
protocols, namely ICMP, RDP, and SSH, from any source within the VPC
network. Then, you\'ll enable logging on the remaining firewall rules.

### ** Customize firewall rules**

Delete the **default-allow-icmp**, **default-allow-rdp**,
and **default-allow-ssh** firewall rules. These rules are overly broad
and by deleting them, you\'ll allow for a more secure and controlled
network environment.

By deleting these rules, you have restricted access to these protocols,
limiting the potential for unauthorized access attempts and reducing the
attack surface of your network.

### ** Enable logging**

Enable logging for the remaining firewall rules **limit-ports** (the
rule you created in a previous task) and **default-allow-internal**.

Enabling logging allows you to track and analyze the traffic that is
allowed by this rule, which is likely to be internal traffic between
instances within your VPC.

By customizing firewall rules and enabling logging, you\'ve addressed
the **Open SSH port**, **Open RDP port**, and **Firewall rule logging
disabled** findings. The new firewall rule better protects the network
and improves network visibility.
