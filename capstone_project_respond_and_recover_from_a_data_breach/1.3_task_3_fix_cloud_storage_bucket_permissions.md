## Task 3. Fix Cloud Storage bucket permissions

In this task, I\'ll revoke public access to the storage bucket and
switch to uniform bucket-level access control, significantly reducing
the risk of data breaches. By removing all user permissions from the
storage bucket, I can prevent unauthorized access to the data stored
within.

1.  In the **Navigation
    menu** (![navigation_menu](media/image1.png){width="0.15625in"
    height="0.1388888888888889in"}), select **Cloud Storage \>
    Buckets**. The Buckets page opens.

2.  Click the **project_id_bucket** storage bucket link. The Bucket
    details page opens.

note there is a **myfile.csv** file in the publicly accessible bucket.
This is the file that contains the sensitive information that was dumped
by the malicious actor. Perform the following steps to address
the **Public bucket ACL** finding.

### **Challenge: Modify storage bucket access**

Switch the access control to uniform and remove permissions for
the **allUsers** principals from the storage bucket to enforce a single
set of permissions for the bucket and its objects. also need to ensure
that users who rely on basic project roles to access the bucket won\'t
lose their access.

By following these steps, I have effectively prevented public access to
the bucket, switched to uniform bucket-level access control, and removed
all user permissions, addressing the **Public bucket ACL**, **Bucket
policy only disabled**, and **Bucket logging disabled** findings.
