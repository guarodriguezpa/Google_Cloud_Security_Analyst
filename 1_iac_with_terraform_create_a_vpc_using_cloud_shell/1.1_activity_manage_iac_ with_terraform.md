**Secure Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform**

In this Activity, I served as a Junior Cloud Security Analyst at Cymbal
Bank, focusing on a core security objective: **validating a Terraform
configuration file for secure and consistent virtual machine (VM)
deployment** as part of their hybrid cloud migration. My goal was to
understand how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) affects infrastructure and
to explain its security benefits.

My actions involved a **review of a standard Terraform template** that
would provision a Google Compute Engine instance within a network.

I **identified the cloud resources** created by different parts of the
code

A key part of my role was to **determine how to change the global
location of VMs**, a requirement for Cymbal Bank\'s global operations.
Additionally, I prepared a response for executive leadership,
**explaining how IaC improves VM and overall infrastructure security**.
This included discussing how IaC promotes consistency, reduces
configuration drift, and allows for automated security checks early in
the development process, addressing risks like invalid code inputs.

**Goals for the project include:**

● Goal 1: Examine a Terraform configuration file.

● Goal 2: Describe what cloud resources the different pieces of code
create in the file.

● Goal 3: Identify how to change a virtual machine's location.

● Goal 4: Explain how incorporating IaC can improve security.

**This Terraform configuration will create the following Google Cloud
resources:**

1.  A custom VPC network named my-custom-mode-network.

2.  A subnetwork named my-custom-subnet within my-custom-mode-network,
    located in the us-west1 region with an IP range of 10.0.1.0/24.

3.  A Compute Engine VM instance named flask-vm in the us-west1-a zone.
    This VM will be an f1-micro type, run Debian 11, have Flask
    installed on startup, and be connected to my-custom-subnet with an
    external IP address.

Let\'s break down this Terraform configuration to understand the Google
Cloud resources it will create:

**1. Google_compute_network \"vpc_network\"**

- **Resource Type:** google_compute_network

- **What it creates:** A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network.

- **Name:** \"my-custom-mode-network\"

- **Configuration:**

  - auto_create_subnetworks = false: This indicates that subnetworks
    will *not* be automatically created within this VPC. They will need
    to be defined explicitly (as we see in the next resource block).

**2. Google_compute_subnetwork \"default\"**

- **Resource Type:** google_compute_subnetwork

- **What it creates:** A subnetwork within the previously defined VPC
  network.

- **Name:** \"my-custom-subnet\"

- **Configuration:**

  - **ip_range** = \"10.0.1.0/24\": Defines the IP address range for
    this subnetwork.

  - **Region** = \"us-west1\": Specifies that this subnetwork will be
    located in the us-west1 Google Cloud region.

  - **Network** = google_compute_network.vpc_network.id: This is a
    crucial line. It links this subnetwork to the vpc_network created in
    the first resource block, ensuring it\'s part of
    \"my-custom-mode-network.\"

**3. Google_compute_instance \"default\"**

- **Resource Type:** Google_compute_instance

- **What it creates:** A single Google Compute Engine virtual machine
  (VM) instance.

- **Name:** \"flask-vm\"

- **Configuration:**

  - **Machine_type =** \"f1-micro\": Specifies the machine type, which
    determines the VM\'s virtual CPU and memory. f1-micro is a small,
    cost-effective instance type.

  - **Zone** = \"us-west1-a\": Defines the specific zone within the
    us-west1 region where the VM will be deployed.

  - **tags** = \[\"ssh\"\]: Applies the \"ssh\" network tag to the VM.
    This tag can be used in firewall rules to control access to the VM
    (e.g., allowing SSH traffic).

  - **boot_disk block:**

    - **image** = \"debian-cloud/debian-11\": The VM will be initialized
      with a Debian 11 operating system image.

  - **metadata_startup_script:**

    - \"sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install -yq build-essential
      python3-pip rsync; pip install flask\": This script will execute
      when the VM starts up. It will:

      - Update the package lists.

      - Install essential build tools, Python 3 pip, and rsync.

      - Install the Flask Python web framework using pip.

  - **Network_interface block:**

    - **Subnetwork** = google_compute_subnetwork.default.id: The VM will
      be attached to the \"my-custom-subnet\" created in the second
      resource block.

    - **Access_config {}:** This empty block is significant because its
      presence ensures that the VM is assigned an external (public) IP
      address, allowing it to be accessed from the internet (assuming
      appropriate firewall rules are in place).

**Conclusion:**

This activity reinforced my practical understanding of Infrastructure as
Code (IaC) by guiding me through Terraform file analysis and Google
Compute Engine provisioning.

It provided hands-on experience in automating secure, consistent cloud
infrastructure deployments and highlighted the strategic value of IaC in
managing global VM placement. Additionally, the exercise enhanced my
ability to clearly articulate how IaC contributes to the scalability,
reliability, and security posture of Cymbal Bank's cloud environment.
