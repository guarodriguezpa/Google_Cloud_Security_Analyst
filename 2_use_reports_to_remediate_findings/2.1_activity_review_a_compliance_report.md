**Activity: Review a compliance report**

In this activity, I will review the **results** of a compliance report
pertaining to a NIST compliance framework. Then, I will identify
ineffective security controls that are creating compliance gaps and
outline solution(s) to remediate the compliance report findings.

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal and external
standards and government regulations. To meet compliance requirements,
organizations use a compliance lifecycle, a process for ensuring
compliance objectives are met and maintained to support the business
goals.

Security controls are also a key part of both security and compliance.
Implementing security controls to reduce risk is a critical part of a
cloud security professional\'s role.

**Scenario:**

As a **Cloud Security Analyst** recently certified in Google Cloud
Security, I played a key role in a critical project at Cymbal Bank. The
bank is undergoing a rapid digital transformation, adopting a **hybrid
cloud model** that blends on-premises infrastructure with cloud
services. While this shift brings significant benefits, it also
introduces complexities, particularly in asset configuration and
maintaining compliance with various regulatory frameworks.

My team was specifically tasked with implementing **NIST SP 800-53
security recommendations** to address compliance gaps. This
comprehensive framework provides a catalog of security controls, crucial
for protecting information systems.

My contribution involved analyzing a compliance report for cloud
resources within a specific cloud project. My goal was to **identify
ineffective cloud security controls** contributing to compliance
deficiencies and subsequently provide concrete **recommendations for
remediation**.

This project was vital in helping Cymbal Bank strengthen its security
posture and meet its compliance obligations in the evolving hybrid cloud
environment.

**Step 1:**\
Acces supporting materials:

- NIST SP 800-53 compliance report: (step 3)

- Security controls table: (step 2)

- Compliance report notes: (step 4)

**Step 2:**

Review the Security controls table. **NIST SP 800-53** has over a
thousand security and privacy controls. Reviewing all of these controls
is beyond the scope of this activity, but you should know that these
security controls are categorized into 20 control families.

Each control family contains security controls that are related to the
specific topic of the family. For example, the control family
Identification and Authentication (IA) deals with security controls
involving identity and access management. Each security control within
the family is identified with a control number (for example, IA-1).

Security controls table

NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 organizes security and privacy controls into
20 control families. Each control family contains controls that are
related to the specific topic of the family.

Each control family also uses a unique identifier.

For example, the identifier for **Configuration Management** is
**CM**---this topic relates to the configuration of systems. The
following table lists the 20 control families and their identifiers.

**Step 3:**

**\### AQUÍ VA UNA HOJA DE EXCEL###**

Analyze the compliance report Analyze the details of the NIST SP 800-53
compliance report. Examine each of the columns, which contain the
following information:

● **Control family:** This column contains the NIST SP 800-53 control
family related to the finding. Notice that not all 20 of the control
families are listed

● **Finding categories:** An abbreviation of the description of the
security control.

● **Severity:** The risk level of the finding category: low, medium, or
high

● **Description:** A description of the compliance issue

● **Affected resource(s):** The name and number of resources that are
affected with each compliance standard. A count of 0 indicates that no
ineffective security controls were found

**Step 4:**

Identify the ineffective security controls After you\'ve reviewed the
Compliance report, identify the four ineffective security controls.
